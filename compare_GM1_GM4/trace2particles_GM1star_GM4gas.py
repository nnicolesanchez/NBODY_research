# This script tracks two particles across all timsteps
#      Both particles:
#           x, y, z, v, rho, temp, metals
#           ** When stars set rho & temp = 0 
#           ** Multiply xyz * v by expansion factor

# These are two particles which for stars in GM1 but
# remain only gas (form no stars) in GM4
